# OldArowonaWebsite
Created my personal website using Pythons Flask micro framework.HTML5 and CSS3 were used to develop the front end. The final product is deployed via Heroku and could've be found at www.arowona.com.

Other Key Features:
- Found in the routes page the script has been automated to send emails to both myself and the user, using flask's mail module.
